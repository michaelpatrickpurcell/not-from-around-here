# Overview
This is a worldbuilding game.
It is intended for groups of three to six players and can be played in about one hour.

You will assume the roles of hospitality workers at a tropical resort.
Recently, your clientele has started to include an increasing number of extraterrestrial aliens.
The general manager has called a meeting to discuss the situation.

You will ask and answer a series of questions about your alien guests and how they will affect life at the resort.
By doing so, you will describe the world your characters inhabit.

# Characters
You will portray a hospitality worker who is employed at an all-inclusive tropical resort. To create your character,
  1. Describe what you do at the resort.
  2. Describe your mannerisms and physical appearance.
  3. Describe two types of factual questions about the aliens that you can answer.
  4. Describe one alien-related problem that you would like to solve at the meeting.

Introduce yourself to the other characters before the meeting begins.

# Gameplay
The game takes place over five rounds. 
During each of the first four rounds, you will discuss one topic that the general manager has identified as being of particular interest.
During the last round, you will discuss how to respond to the issues raised in previous rounds. 

## Topics
The general manager has identified four topics of particular interest for discussion:
  1. Dining and Entertainment
  2. Guest Safety and Comfort
  3. Payment and Gratuities
  4. Reputation and Marketing

In each of the first four rounds, you will discuss one of these topics.

## Facilitators
One player should act as the facilitator in each round. Their job is to ensure that everyone has a chance to contribute and that the discussion stays focused on the topic at hand.

## Questions
During the game, you will ask and answer questions about both the aliens and the game's setting.
You will invent the answers to these questions as they arise to describe the world that your characters inhabit.

### Factual Questions

Factual questions are questions about the nature of some part of the game's setting.
These questions are usually stated using one of the standard interrogatives: who, what, where, when, why, and how.

Whoever is best suited to answer each factual question should do so.
Your answers should be consistent with any details about the setting that have been previously established.
Beyond that, however, you are free to invent any details you like as a part of your answers.

### Socratic Questions
Socratic questions are questions that encourage critical thinking.
These questions frequently arise as follow-up questions after a player establishes a new detail about the game's setting.

Socratic questions are often intended to do one or more of the following:
  1. Clarify concepts
  2. Challenge assumptions
  3. Probe evidence
  4. Discover alternative viewpoints
  5. Explore implications

After someone answers a factual question, you should use Socratic questions to help them flesh out their answer and explain how any new details they introduced interact with other details that had been previously established.

## Action Items
During the last round, your job is to decide what you are going to do next.
You should describe what you think needs to be done, what you can do yourselves, and what you need help with.

As in the previous rounds, you should use Socratic questions to help each other understand what you are proposing and why you think that your proposal describes a reasonable course of action.
